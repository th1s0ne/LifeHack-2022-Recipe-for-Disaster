# LifeHack-2022-Recipe-for-Disaster
Have YOU ever bought new ingredients in bulk for a new recipe, then found yourself struggling to finish them off? One contributing factor to food waste in Singapore is the underutilisation of leftover ingredients. Often, when ingredients that cannot be purchased in smaller denominations expire or spoil, people are forced to throw them away for lack of better options. For example, to make a dish requiring lemon slices, one must purchase a full lemon. However, after slicing the lemon into slices and using a few, there will be a small amount of lemon left that cannot be stored for long. People that are less experienced with cooking or lack the time to cook often elect to throw such small quantities of food away due to either lack of knowledge or laziness. 

Our Objectives: 
- To reduce food waste by providing users with 2 options:
    1. Allowing users to search for recipes **by ingredients**, so that are able to utilise their leftover ingredients in new meals.
    2. Giving the user a list of food donation points in their area to give away their excess ingredients.
- Make reducing food waste simpler and more accessible by educating users with tips & videos about food waste.

Execution: Telegram bot that handles 3 main commands: /search (to search for recipes from a recipe database collection), /donate (to retrieve a list of nearby food donation boxes) & /learn (to find out more about how to reduce food waste).

Target Audience: Mobile users
