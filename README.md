# LifeHack-2022-Recipe-for-Disaster
One contributing factor to food waste in Singapore is leftover ingredients. Often, when ingredients that cannot be purchased in smaller denominations expire or spoil, people are forced to throw them away for lack of better options. For example, to make a dish requiring lemon slices, one must purchase a full lemon. However, after slicing the lemon into slices and using a few, there will be a small amount of lemon left that cannot be stored for long. People that are less experienced with cooking or lack the time to cook often elect to throw such small quantities of food away due to either lack of knowledge or laziness.
